    "section": "2. Data Cleaning and Visualization",
    "text": "2. Data Cleaning and Visualization\nWhen working with real-world data, it is common to encounter missing or erroneous values, inconsistent formatting, and other issues. Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting these problems in the data to ensure that it is accurate and reliable for analysis. Visualization, on the other hand, is the process of representing data in a visual format such as graphs, charts, or maps, to help analysts identify patterns and trends.\nFor this blog post, we will be using a data set from Kaggle’s House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. This data set contains information on various attributes of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, including their sale prices. The goal of the competition is to build a model that can accurately predict the sale prices of homes based on these attributes.\nTo start, we will import the necessary libraries in Python, including Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for visualization. We will then load the data set using the read_csv() function from Pandas.\n\n\n\nNow that we have loaded the data, we can begin the data cleaning process. The first step is to check for missing values in the data. We can use the isnull() function from Pandas to check for missing values and the sum() function to count the number of missing values in each column.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# remove the comment to load the dataset\n#df = pd.read_csv(\"train.csv\")\n\n# Check for missing values\nmissing_values = df.isnull().sum()\nprint(missing_values)\n\nId                 0\nMSSubClass         0\nMSZoning           0\nLotFrontage      259\nLotArea            0\n                ... \nMoSold             0\nYrSold             0\nSaleType           0\nSaleCondition      0\nSalePrice          0\nLength: 81, dtype: int64\n\n\nThis will give us a count of missing values in each column of the data set. We can then decide how to handle these missing values, depending on the amount of missing data and the nature of the problem. In this case, we will simply drop the columns with more than 50% missing values.\nNext, we can check for any duplicate rows in the data set using the duplicated() function from Pandas. If there are any duplicate rows, we can drop them using the drop_duplicates() function.\n\n\n\n# Drop columns with more than 50% missing values\ndf = df.dropna(thresh=len(df)*0.5, axis=1)\n\n# Check for duplicates\nduplicates = df.duplicated()\nprint(duplicates.sum())\n\n# Drop duplicates\n\n0\n\ndf = df.drop_duplicates()\n\nNow that we have cleaned the data, we can move on to visualization. One common visualization for exploring the relationship between two variables is a scatter plot. We can create a scatter plot of the sale prices and the living area of the homes using Matplotlib.\n\n# Create a histogram of sale prices\nplt.hist(df[\"SalePrice\"], bins=20)\n\n(array([ 22., 126., 380., 343., 229., 144.,  86.,  49.,  28.,  23.,  12.,\n         7.,   3.,   1.,   2.,   1.,   2.,   0.,   0.,   2.]), array([ 34900.,  70905., 106910., 142915., 178920., 214925., 250930.,\n       286935., 322940., 358945., 394950., 430955., 466960., 502965.,\n       538970., 574975., 610980., 646985., 682990., 718995., 755000.]), <BarContainer object of 20 artists>)\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Sale Price ($)\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Frequency\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis will give us a visual representation of the distribution of sale prices in the data set. We can see that the distribution is skewed to the right, with a few homes having very high sale prices.\nBy cleaning and visualizing the data, we can gain a better understanding of its properties and identify any potential issues that may need to be addressed before building a linear regression model."

Building a Linear Regression Model\nNow that we have cleaned and visualized the data, we can start building a linear regression model to predict the sale prices of homes based on their attributes. Linear regression is a statistical technique that is commonly used for predicting a numeric value based on one or more input variables. In this case, we will use the input variables in the data set to predict the sale price of each home.\nTo start, we will split the data set into a training set and a validation set using the train_test_split() function from Scikit-learn.

This information can be useful for real estate professionals, home buyers, and sellers looking to estimate the value of a residential property."

    "text": "Performance\nAfter building our decision tree model, it is important to evaluate its performance. We can use various metrics to evaluate the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Before getting to the code, let’s understand the metrics.\nThe accuracy score tells us the percentage of correctly classified instances out of all instances.\naccuracy = (number of correct predictions) / (total number of predictions)\nThe precision score tells us the percentage of instances that were correctly classified as a certain class out of all instances classified as that class.\nPrecision = (true positives) / (true positives + false positives)\nThe recall score tells us the percentage of instances that were correctly classified as a certain class out of all instances of that class.\nRecall = (true positives) / (true positives + false negatives)\nF1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a measure of the balance between precision and recall and is a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\nF1 score = 2 * ((precision * recall) / (precision + recall))\nIn these formulas, true positives are the number of correctly predicted instances of a particular class, false positives are the number of instances that were incorrectly predicted as that class, and false negatives are the number of instances of that class that were incorrectly predicted as another class.\nThe confusion matrix is a table that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.\n\n\n# Evaluate the model\nprint(\"Accuracy: {:.2f}%\".format(100 * accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)))\n\nAccuracy: 97.01%\n\nprint(\"Precision: {:.2f}%\".format(100 * precision_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')))\n\nPrecision: 97.20%\n\nprint(\"Recall: {:.2f}%\".format(100 * recall_score(y_test, y_pred, average='weighted')))\n\nRecall: 97.01%\n\nprint(\"F1 score: {:.2f}%\".format(100 * f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')))\n\nF1 score: 97.00%\n\nprint(\"Confusion Matrix:\\n\", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))\n\nConfusion Matrix:\n [[31  0  0]\n [ 2 16  0]\n [ 0  0 18]]\n\n\nWe can see that our model has an accuracy of 97%, which means it correctly classified 97% of instances. The precision and recall scores are also high, indicating that our model performed well in classifying instances for each class. The confusion matrix provides us with more detailed information about the number of correctly and incorrectly classified instances for each class.\nLet’s take a look at the decision tree we made.\n\n\n# Visualize the decision tree\ndot_data = export_graphviz(tree, out_file=None, \n                           feature_names=data_final_vars,  \n                           class_names=['Adelie', 'Chinstrap', 'Gentoo'],  \n                           filled=True, rounded=True,  \n                           special_characters=True)  \n\ngraph = graphviz.Source(dot_data)  \n\n# create the plot as a png file on your directory\n#graph.render(\"penguins_decision_tree.png\") \n\n\n\n\n\nEach box is called ‘node’, the node shows the rules and the subsets created, it comes together with Gini index, so we can track how pure each node gets.\nLet’s take a better look at the Gini index: \\[\nGini = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^c (p_i)^2\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(c\\) is the number of classes in the target variable\n\\(p_i\\) is the proportion of observations belonging to class i in the node\n\nThe Gini index ranges from 0 to 1, where a Gini index of 0 means all observations in the node belong to the same class (pure node), and a Gini index of 1 means that the node contains an equal proportion of observations from each class (impure node). In general, a lower Gini index indicates a better split for the decision tree.\nYou got it! We’ve covered a lot of ground in this post, from exploring our dataset and identifying key features, to preprocessing our data and training a decision tree model to predict penguin species. And the best part? Our model performed really well. Next we will talk about random forest, until then, keep coding!"

To load the Palmer Penguins dataset, we will use the load_penguins function from the palmerpenguins library. We will also import pandas to create a dataframe to store the data, and seaborn and matplotlib to visualize the data.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\nfrom sklearn.tree import export_graphviz\nimport graphviz\nimport seaborn as sns \nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns \nfrom palmerpenguins import load_penguins\nsns.set_style('whitegrid')\npenguins = load_penguins()\npenguins.head()\n\n  species     island  bill_length_mm  ...  body_mass_g     sex  year\n0  Adelie  Torgersen            39.1  ...       3750.0    male  2007\n1  Adelie  Torgersen            39.5  ...       3800.0  female  2007\n2  Adelie  Torgersen            40.3  ...       3250.0  female  2007\n3  Adelie  Torgersen             NaN  ...          NaN     NaN  2007\n4  Adelie  Torgersen            36.7  ...       3450.0  female  2007\n\n[5 rows x 8 columns]\n\n\nThe head function is used to display the first few rows of the dataset. This is useful to check that the data has been loaded correctly and to get a quick overview of the data. Now let’s look for missing values.\n\n\n# Check for missing values\nprint(penguins.isnull().sum())\n\nspecies               0\nisland                0\nbill_length_mm        2\nbill_depth_mm         2\nflipper_length_mm     2\nbody_mass_g           2\nsex                  11\nyear                  0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nwe don’t always just drop na, but sckitlearn classifiers aren’t able to handle missing values plus we will lose only a few rows, so let’s take the easy way out here. An alternative could be `filling NA`, but it can be dangerous specially if you rely in simple methods like, just using the average value to fill the gaps. Note that, in the real world, we usually deal with many more missing values and the answer could be trying to enrich the dataset with external information, testing another classification model which can deal with missing values or checking more advanced methods to fill the gaps, how would you like a post about that?\n\n# drop missing values \npenguins = penguins.dropna()\n# Double Check for missing values\nprint(penguins.isnull().sum())\n\nspecies              0\nisland               0\nbill_length_mm       0\nbill_depth_mm        0\nflipper_length_mm    0\nbody_mass_g          0\nsex                  0\nyear                 0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nNow that we have checked for missing values, we can visualize the distribution of the target variable using a histogram. In this case, the target variable is the species of the penguin.\n\n# Plot the distribution of the target variable\nplt.hist(penguins['species'])\n\n(array([146.,   0.,   0.,   0.,   0., 119.,   0.,   0.,   0.,  68.]), array([0. , 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1. , 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2. ]), <BarContainer object of 10 artists>)\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the dataset contains three species of penguins: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo.\nFinally, we can use a scatter matrix plot to visualize the pairwise relationships between the features. This is useful to understand the relationships between the features and to identify any potential correlations, or even if there’s a variable worth removing.\n\n# Plot the pairwise relationships between the features\nsns.pairplot(data=penguins, hue='species')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very revealing plot, we can see, for example, that some features are very correlated, meaning that we could probably remove flipper_length_mm for example, and leave body_mass, because they are correlated, you can see what I’m talking about if you look to the graph at row 3 column 4. We also can see how the features interact with the species of the penguins, look at row 4 column 4, for example and you will find out that most of Gentoo penguins are heavier than the others, this indicates that body mass may be important predictor for our decision tree model.\nOk, now we’re read to prep the data"
