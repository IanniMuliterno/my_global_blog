Crypto2 is a package made by Sebastian Stöckl that, as he says in the [official repo](https://github.com/sstoeckl/crypto2), provides `tibbles` with all data available via the web-api of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/). It does not require an API key but in turn only provides information that is also available through the website of [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com/).\n\n`PortfolioAnalytics` provide numerical solutions for portfolio problems with complex constraints and objective sets.\n\nCurrently, supported optimization methods include:\n\n-   random portfolios,\n\n-   differential evolution\n\n-   particle swarm optimization\n\n-   generalized simulated annealing\n\n-   linear and quadratic programming routines\n\nWith that, I studied the packages and defined an investment strategy to run automatically in a shiny application. The result is an app that let's you choose a level of risk, and suggest how you should distribute your investment capital to optimize return, based on your risk aversion. Also, you can see the opening and closing prices of each cryptocurrency you choose.\n\nHere's how it looks like:\n\n![](/posts/2024-03-Crypto_portfolio/cryptoapp.PNG)\n\n[Click here](https://ianmuliterno.shinyapps.io/Crypto-Market-Analysis/) and feel free to use it yourself.\n",
